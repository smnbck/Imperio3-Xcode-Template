# Imperio3.xctemplate
This Xcode Template was made to help users of the Imperio Library (https://github.com/Flinesoft/Imperio) speeding up the creation of screen flows. It creates all the neccessary base classes and hooks them up so you can start directly with your views implementation.

## Installation Instructions
To install the template just drop the Imperio3.xctemplate folder into your Templates folder. Usually it is located at ~user/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates. 

If you want to add the Imperio Template to a specific template sub category in Xcode (e.g. Source, because you want to have it right next to your Swift File Template ðŸ˜ƒ), you have to create another folder inside your Templates directory which has the same name as the category you want to add it to.
